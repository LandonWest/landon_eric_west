      I'm a native of Salt Lake City and a recent transplant to San Francisco. I'm creative at heart and I love <b>technology</b>. Whether it's going to local tech meetups, conferences, or following the greatests minds on Twitter, I like to keep up on the latest gadgets, software and ideas.

      Ever since I can remember I've been pulling things apart to figure out how they work and then trying (sometimes unsuccesfully) to put them back together. The advent of YouTube and Google opened up an amazing world of <b>knowledge</b> for me. With the help of searching the internet and watching how-to videos I felt I could do anything! Replace the radiator in my jeep? Check. Put together the perfect home theatre setup? Check. Build a computer? Check. Find that last Gold Skulltula on Zelda, Ocarina of Time? Check.

      I started learning HTML and CSS online through free tutorials and practiced my first simple websites while working the night shift. I immediately <b>fell in love</b> and knew this was something I wanted to pursue. I had the privilege of attending a full-time, eleven week, full-stack, web development boot camp in Salt Lake City. Hands-down this was one of the <b>most rewarding experiences of my life.</b> Never have I worked so hard, been so mentally fatigued, or felt so incredibly accomplished. I could write a novel on this experience alone, but will save it for another time. Needless to say, I love learning new things and I'm always excited for more.
